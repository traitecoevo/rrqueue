tasks_status:
  short: >-
    Returns a named character vector indicating the task status.

      Optional vector of task identifiers.  If omitted all tasks known
      to rrqueue will be used.
    follow_redirect: >-

    values are the status of each task.  Possible status values are
    \describe{
    \item{\code{PENDING}}{queued, but not run by a worker}
    \item{\code{RUNNING}}{being run on a worker, but not complete}

  params:
    task_ids: *task_ids
    unit_elapsed: >-
      Unit to use in computing elapsed times.  The default is to use
      "secs".  This is passed through to \code{\link{difftime}} so the
      units there are available and are "auto", "secs", "mins",
      "hours", "days", "weeks".

    A named character vector; names are the task ids and the value is
    the environment id associated with that task.

task_get:
  short: >-
    returns a \code{\link{task}} object associated with a given task
    identifier.  This can be used to interrogate an individual task.
    See the help for \code{\link{task}} objects for more about these objects.
  params:
    task_id: &task_id A single task identifier

task_result:
  short: >-
    Get the result for a single task
  params:
    task_id: *task_id
    follow_redirect: &follow_redirect >-
      should we follow redirects to get the status of any requeued task?

tasks_groups_list:
  short: >-
    Returns list of \emph{groups} known to rrqueue.  Groups are
    assigned during task creation, or through the
    \code{tasks_set_group} method of \code{link{queue}}.

tasks_in_groups:
  short: >-
    Returns a list of tasks belonging to any of the groups listed.
  params:
    groups: >-
      A character vector of one or more groups (use

    \code{\link{task_bundle}}
  params:
    groups: A vector of groups to include in the bundle
    task_ids: >-
      A vector of task ids in the bundle.  Unlike all other uses of
      \code{task_ids} here, only one of \code{groups} or
      \code{task_ids} can be provided, so if \code{task_ids=NULL} then
      \code{task_ids} is ignored and \code{groups} is used.

envirs_list:
  short: >-
    Return a vector of all known environment ids in this queue.
envirs_contents:
  short: >-
    Return a vector of the environment contents
  params:

    particular environment.
  params:
    envir_id: A single environment id
    worker_ids: &worker_ids
      Optional vector of worker identifiers.  If omitted all workers known

    environment, named by the worker identifers.

workers_len:

    There are situations where this is an overestimate and that may
    get fixed at some point.

workers_list:
  short: >-
    Returns a vector of all known worker identifiers (may include
    workers that have crashed).

workers_list_exited:
  short: >-
    Returns a vector of workers that are known to have exited.
    Workers leave behind most of the interesting bits of logs, times,
    etc, so these identifiers are useful for asking what they worked
    on.

workers_status:
  short: >-
    Returns a named character vector indicating the task status.
  params:
    worker_ids: *worker_ids
  value: |

    \item{\code{LOST}}{worker has been lost; this is only currently
    detectable via detecting orphan jobs}
    }

workers_times:
  short: >-
    returns a summary of times for a set of workers.  This only
    returns useful information if the workers are running a heartbeat
    process, which requires the \code{RedisHeartbeat} package.
  params:
    worker_ids: *worker_ids
    unit_elapsed: >-
      Unit to use in computing elapsed times.  The default is to use
      "secs".  This is passed through to \code{\link{difftime}} so the
      units there are available and are "auto", "secs", "mins",
      "hours", "days", "weeks".
  value: |
    A \code{data.frame}, one row per worker, with columns
    \describe{
    \item{\code{worker_id}}{Worker identifier}
    \item{\code{expire_max}}{Maximum length of time before worker can
      be declared missing, in seconds}
    \item{\code{expire}}{Time until the worker will expire, in seconds}
    \item{\code{last_seen}}{Time since the worker was last seen}
    \item{\code{last_action}}{Time since the last worker action}
    }

  short: >-
    Return the last few entries in the worker logs.
  params:

    \describe{
    \item{\code{worker_id}}{the worker identifier}
    \item{\code{time}}{time of the event}
    \item{\code{command}}{the command (e.g., MESSAGE, ALIVE)}
    \item{\code{message}}{The message associated with the command}
    }

workers_info:
  short: >-
    Returns a set of key/value information about workers.  Includes
    things like hostnames, process ids, environments that can be run,
    etc.  Note that this information is from the last time that the
    worker process registered an \code{INFO} command.  This is
    registered at startup and after recieving a \code{INFO} message
    from a \code{\link{queue}} object.  So the information may be out
    of date.
  params:
    worker_ids: *worker_ids
  value: |
    A list, each element of which is a \code{worker_info}

worker_envir:
  short: >-
    Returns an up-to-date list of environments a worker is capable of
    using (in contrast to the entry in \code{workers_info} that might
    be out of date.
  params:
    worker_id: Single worker identifier
