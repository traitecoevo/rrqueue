\usage{
worker_spawn(queue_name, logfile, redis_host = "127.0.0.1",
  redis_port = 6379, n = 1, timeout = 20, time_poll = 1,
  heartbeat_period = NULL, heartbeat_expire = NULL, path = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{queue_name}{Name of the queue to connect to}

\item{logfile}{Name of a log file to write to (consider
\code{tempfile()}).  If \code{n} > 1, then \code{n} log files
must be provided.}

\item{redis_host}{Host name/IP for the Redis server}

\item{redis_port}{Port for the Redis server}

\item{n}{Number of workers to spawn}

\item{timeout}{Time to wait for the worker to appear}

\item{time_poll}{Period to poll for the worker (must be in
seconds)}

\item{heartbeat_period}{Period between heartbeat pulses}

\item{heartbeat_expire}{Time that heartbeat pulses will persist}

\item{path}{Path to start the worker in.  By default workers will
start in the current working directory, but you can start them
elsewhere by providing a path here.  If the path does not exist,
an error will be thrown.  If \code{n} is greater than 1, all
workers will start in the same working directory.  The
\code{logfile} argument will be interpreted relative to current
working directory (not the worker working directory); use
\code{\link{normalizePath}} to convert into an absolute path
name to prevent this.}

\description{
Spawn a worker in the background
}
\details{
Spawning multiple workers.  If \code{n} is greater than one,
multiple workers will be spawned.  This happens in parallel so it
does not take n times longer than spawing a single worker.

Beware that signals like Ctrl-C passed to \emph{this} R instance
can still propagate to the child processes and can result in them
dying unexpectedly.  It is probably safer to start processes in a
standalone session.
